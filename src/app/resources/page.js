						We understand the sensitive nature of health data and peoples
						concern around the safety of their personal data and health records.
						That’s why, we are developing MediBank on HL7 FHIR standards so it
						is designed to be flexible, adaptable and can be used in a wide
						range of settings with different health care information systems.
						This done in combination with an AES-256bit encryption which is
						currently the strongest and commonly used encryption method. We have
						also put in place multi factor authentication protocols to ensure no
						health record or data is accessed without user permission. Our
						privacy policy clearly explains all that a user needs to know about
						what information we collect, how we store it, use it and share it
						with. Please click below to read more about it.
